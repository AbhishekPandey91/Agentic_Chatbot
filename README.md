# Conversational Agentic Chatbot

This project is an advanced conversational AI chatbot built with Streamlit and LangChain. It leverages a multi-agent system to handle complex user requests by breaking them down into tasks and assigning them to a team of specialized AI agents.

**Please note:** This is a demo application where the agents simulate or "mock" task completion to showcase the routing and planning logic, without performing real-world actions.
